# Multi-language Documentation

There will almost certainly be a substantial bias toward English-language source material in this project repository. For the purposes of automated translation, the source files are authored in English and translated to other languages, most if not all of the time.

However, if there is a need or want to practice content translation to other languages (and this may include any to any translation, the presumption of English language bias need not hold).

Please indicate per-file whether it is a source document, or a translation from a source document in another language, and make that indication in the language of the localized document.

## Translation Workflow

In order to be inclusive across language barriers, the documentation for this project is made translatable into other languages using the [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/) tools which have, as of this writing, been made available in the organization as an application to use for any repository.
