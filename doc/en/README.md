# HOWTO Documentation (English Edition)

These are English language sources and/or translations of Project-ACT HOWTOs and other methods and best practices, intended to be informative, normative, and in some cases authoritative information for those just joining or participation with Project-ACT as a civic volunteer, or for anyone who wants to see what goes on and how. As is stated in the top-level README, this is a live repository, always subject to revision to keep our volunteer organization operating smoothly.

## Origin

These documents are based on a similar document structure prepared by and with permission of the [Innovate for Vegas Foundation](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/), a founding member of *Project-ACT*. That original document repository is located at [InnovateForVegas/doc-org-howtos](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/doc-org-howtos/).
