# Naming and Versioning

“There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.”—Phil Karlton

This is arguably applicable to nearly everything, from naming a child to naming a product to naming a company to naming a new star in a galaxy far, far away. Naming things can have contextual implications, cultural and linguistic implications, and regular old legal implications. They can also inform, or confuse, depending on which name you choose related to other names adjacent, in the present or in the future.

As with most things, there are various opinions when it comes to naming conventions, not to mention how best to express which version of that thing is available or in use or coming soon. For the sake of clarity, and to remove another few potential choices to make, we have some lines drawn in the sand regarding these two critically useful notions.

## Naming Things

There is a brief summary of this information in the Contributing.md document for all projects on which Project-ACT is working, herein is an expanded treatise on the topic…

Each Project will be comprised of many parts, some contained within repositories, others elsewhere. A top-level repository with this consistent naming scheme will help others to locate this top level and navigate the project component hierarchy: the Overview Project Repository.

### Overview Repo ov-(project-name)

This is the top-level OverView repository, which will contain a high-level description of the project itself, a project specification if available, and any other relevant high-level resources and information. As an aside, it is important to note that this part of any project may be the starting point against which a backlog of issues may be opened before actual project work in other repositories or other external workspaces begins to take place. By using this repository in this way, a convenient entry point with a well-known naming scheme will enable newcomers to a project to start at the beginning.

### General prefix scheme

Additional repositories added to the project should adhere to a similar naming scheme, for example, **be-(project-name)** for backend code, **fe-(project-name)** for frontend code, **doc-(project-name)** for separate project documentation (perhaps including i18n and l10n work), and more may be added. This convention will, ideally, make navigating the GitHub repository organizational scheme (which is not much) easier as more repositories are added. Note that adding a suffix to **project-name** is acceptable to indicate more detail (eg if there is more than one backend or frontend repo for a given project, for experimentation or other).

Here is a tabular example summary of some naming convention ideas that could make navigating a sea of repositories easier:

| Example Repository Name       | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ov-project-name               | Overview repository, top-level summary README, specs, dev documentation, etc                  |
| be-component-py               | A backend part of the project, written mostly in python                                       |
| fe-component-js               | A frontend part of the project, written in javascript                                         |
| api-project-name              | A stand-alone API coded spec (OpenAPI, etc) separated from language/platform implementation   |
| spi-project-name              | A System Programming Interface, an API for internal use (between services, etc)               |
| db-project-sql                | A database schema definition in sql                                                           |
| doc-project                   | Project documentation intended for external use (users, developers, etc)                      |
| app-project-js                | A stand-alone or native application component of a project                                    |
| ui-project                    | User Interface designs and elements, possibly in html, svg, or similar textual forms          |

Organization of each repository, and of project components not stored within GitHub or a git repository in general, are likely to have their own particular needs based on programming language, architectural choices, and sensibility. Aside from inclusion of LICENSE and other standard files to comply with the Innovate for Vegas open source development and publishing scheme, naming conventions and repository organization are left to the contributors and consensus per repository.

### Reasoning behind name prefixes

GitHub does not make it easy to group projects. The repository tags (see next section) are useful, but not sufficient. The advent of Star Lists is interesting, but not ideal

The choices for structured repository naming come down to either a fixed project name prefix, a language or framework prefix, or a repository type prefix. The name of the repository may vary from the project name per component repo as appropriate (for example, within the Infrastructure project, there is this repository called doc-org-howtows which does not explicitly include the project name), and it we can group projects wit the repository tags detailed below for project and name, where the tags themselves have the problem use cases described.

For structured naming, then, and with GitHub presenting projects sorted most easily by name or last-commit date (that is, Last Update, Name, and the not-useful Stars sort options) in the browser based interface, a prefix that indicates the repository type (see table above for examples) will naturally sort repositories into type sections, with the name of the project component useful thereafter to drill down to the desired component(s). A trailing language and/or framework suffix allows for similarly-named project components implemented in multiple ways, or with multiple types of external tools.

Note also, this naming scheme is useful outside of GitHub, if there are multiple repositories in your local environment you can quickly sort and identify which is for what.

### Project Repository Naming Example

| Example Repository Name       | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ov-tessellation               | Top-level overview repository with actual project name and no language/framework suffix       |
| fe-graph-edit-py              | A front-end RDF editor written in python                                                      |
| fe-graph-edit-ts              | A front-end RDF editor written in typescript                                                  |
| db-mosaic-base-sql            | An SQL database schema design for storing data about elements of the tessellation             |
| api-tessellation              | A language-agnostic API spec (eg OpenAPI) for project access to graph data                    |
| be-graph-spider-py            | A back-end automated site crawler to update existing and gather new graph nodes               |

The number of project components may change over time, and there is room for experimentation and retiring of one or more repositories in favor of one or more others, and so on. A search by project name will be useful, but since in this example each repository contains the project name the search results will be conclusive, if at any time a repository is added called eg bus-rider it would be effectively hidden from search results without prior knowledge. This naming scheme does not address that at all, other than increase the possibility of coming across this naming variation if one is looking for front-end projects and fe-graph-edit-py appears in the result set.

### Naming other things

Many frameworks and some languages have a preferred or de facto naming scheme, especially when a skeletal project or scaffolding tool is used to start a project. In these cases, it is useful to follow the naming scheme for that platform or framework or language, since familiarity will help others when they join the project, or if you yourself move from one project to another. Naming files and components using common and well-known patterns can save time and help to ascend the learning curve.

Naming of variables and functions and other modules is the topic countless articles, books, lectures, YouTube and other tutorial videos, and repository discussions. If we revisit the quote by Phil Karlton one last time, it certainly applies here, to a place in your workflow where expedience or convenience or fatigue or various other factors lead to CamelCase, hyphenated-variables, type prefix tpLetters, under_scores, uselessly-named index or counter variables (i, x, n), confusing function names that doit(): but what exactly, and the list of possibilities continues. If there is a pattern set in the project repository, try to continue that, but make note of whether the selected naming scheme is useful, confusing, or otherwise. It is one of the two hard problems, after all.

### Repository Topic Tags

GitHub enables use of repository tags to help locate repositories. These are global to the GitHub platform and will reveal all public repositories to all seeking a matching tag, which can be useful in some case but less than useful in others. They are visible in a Topic search on GitHub.

The smallest useful unit of work for our purposes within git and GitHub (and GitLab and others) is the project repository, and in an organization with many contributors the number of individual repositories associated with one or more projects can grow quickly. The ability to sort and group and search and list repositories can become a bit of a challenge. The tagging scheme can be useful, even with the caveat that tags on public repositories are visible globally. We can make an effort to isolate our own tags for our own sorting needs withing our organization.

We can accomplish some isolation by prefixing our repository tags with a known and uncommon prefix and hyphen, not unlike the repository naming scheme described above. Thus

A tag *transformation* may show up across countless projects within GitHub. Using the naming prefix will avoid losing our limited search result set to a larger adoption of a particular topic tag later.

This is not a guarantee, but it does make organization-wide topic tags more useful for a longer period of time. It is also possible and simple to add additional topic tags so that particular repositories **do** appear in searches for related topics. For example, a *python* or *postgresql* topic tag will place a particular project into those topics, along with eg *p-act-transformation*.
